# ByteCoin-iOS13
Check your Bitcoin price on the way!

## Goal 
The goal of this project was to implement what I learned recently about Networking, fetching data from the API, Creating an URL, URLSession, Session Task,
parsing JSON data, extensions in swift, etc. by creating a project called "ByteCoin" that allows you to check the Bitcoin price in your local currency.
